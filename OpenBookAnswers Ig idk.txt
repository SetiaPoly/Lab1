Why is it necessary to have "git add" in the git workflow?
- Adds new/changed files into working directory to git staging area.

What is the purpose of describing the changes in commit commands?
- Save the changes and note the changes you have included so to keep track of the changes in the code.

What does the green and red color coded line means when you issue git diff?
- Green identifies the code to be modified whereas red identifies the code to be unmodified.

Under what circumstances will you use branching in a software development project?
- To make changes that do not affect the main code.

What does the term "origin" refer to in the above command?
- To push out main repository other than the branches that were made.

Do you need the "--set-upstream" option for subsequent git push commands?
- No, as --set-upstream is to push the current branch and would view it as a default branch to be pushed each time it's being pushed.
